>New years 1926
>AKA the last year of normalcy for you
>to the average layman, you were just an ordinary college/university student who worked part time as a chef for a local cafe
>To those who knew you you, however?
>You were a smuggler, you sail up and down the Mississippi River, collecting cases upon cases of illicit goods
>Those goods? Bottles of imported alcohol
>Yes, prohibition had put a damper on what should have been a decade of pure unabashed pleasure, especially considering what happened a decade ago
>But you had to admit this life paid off well
>You made enough from both your jobs to live in a (relatively) comfortable place 
>as well as tasting and serving up liquid courage to those who need it
>Such as the new years ball that was going on
>The local jazz band played playful ditties to dance sensation rags
>And those too tired to go on went to the bar to have a drink
>Working as the chef meant you were the de facto bartender, serving drinks that you had an idea about in how to make
>One individual, however, catches your eye in comparison to the others 
>Ivy Pepper, goddaughter to the speakeasy owner, Atlas May, A.K.A your boss
>So you put full attention on her, knowing that any mistake can lead to your death
>The gray cat has a sly look on her face, like she isn’t supposed to be here
>”Hey, Viktor’s a bit distracted with a few things, you mind pouring me a champagne cocktail?” She asked
>Look and see Viktor arguing with some patrons, figure there’s no harm in doing so
>After dousing a sugar cube in bitters, and filling the flute with chilled champagne, you hand the to the grey cat, whiskers shaking in anticipation.
>A small sip later, and you realize this is the first time she’s ever drank alcohol, but she’s handling it like a champ
>After a small cough, she turns and realizes that you have a look of worry on your face
>”Hey, why so serious? It’s new years, time to have some fun, hey, why not have a few drinks yourself?”
>You look at her in confusion, I mean, don’t get high (or wasted) on your own supply was engrained into your mind 
>”Oh I’m sure atlas or Mitzi won’t notice a few bottles going missing, c’mon! Have some fun for once!”
>You (reluctantly) agree, after all, it’s new years, it’s the prime time to shake off any cobwebs of last year’s troubles 
>At ivy’s recommendation, you snag a few bottles of whatever you could grab, and head to a private employees only room in the caverns where the speakeasy was hidden
>It was just you two, getting plastered on whatever you managed to grab
>Eventually, both of you are laughing at stories to pass the time until midnight 
>”Hey, Y’know, it’s just us, we could do anything, as long as we don’t bother anyone else”
>The grey cat, makes her way to the door, locking it
>”And a girl like me has her needs, so I’m proposing a little idea”
>”How about we ditch these clothes and make whoopee, whataya say?”
>You, in a mix of stupor and drunkenness, agree to have some fun
>”Good, you just have a seat, this dress is starting to get a bit warm, you mind if i take a few things off?”
>She teased you, first, the white elbow high gloves, then her high heels, then she slowly undoes her dress, leaving only her bra and panties on her
>”Ah, I can’t reach behind my back, you mind helping me?” Ivy teasingly asked
>You of course, help her, and unhooking her bra sent her petit, but supple breasts free
>Ivy gave you an incredibly smug look >“Y’know, it’s a bit rude to stare at a woman like that, but I don’t mind if you have a touch”
>Slowly, your hand softly rubs against her chest, it’s insanely soft, and she lets out a small moan when you massage her breasts
>but before you got greedy, she smacked your hand
>”Now lets not get too comfortable yet, I still got these Underpants on me, and your little buddy seems like he wants out too”
>You look down, and sure enough, your erection was pressing against your pants
>Ivy stoops down, slowly undoing your belt and pants, and after a slow pull of your underwear, your boner springs free
>”Oh my, eager to meet me, aren’t you, big boy?” Ivy teases you
>Grabbing it with her paw/hands, her soft fur and pads made you shudder in pleasure
>At first, she goes slowly up and down your shaft, feeling her hot breath on your dick makes you desperate for her mouth
>And after a few moments, Ivy obliges, first, a lick, then inch by inch, she goes down until she’s at the base of your cock
>Her mouth is hot, soft, and with her cat tongue, a bit rough too
>At first, she paced herself to make sure you didn’t cum too quickly
>But she soon began to speed up, her mouth pleasing your member, while one of her hands was massaging your balls.
>Soon, you can’t take any more, and you cum into her mouth, painting her throat white
>she swallowed your load, before her mouth moved away from your dick,
>”Thanks for that, but I think that it’s my turn now.”
>She lays back on a poker table, before removing her soaked underwear
>Spreading her pussy, she lulls you in with her finger
>At first, you go in with your fingers, rubbing her sopping wet pussy
>You wouldn’t call her shaved, but very well kept
>slip one finger in, she’s insanely hot and her pussy in tightening around your fingers
>After a few moments of fingering, you pull your fingers out, wet from ivy’s pussy
>Tempted to lick the juices on your fingers to taste, but decide to go directly to the source 
>Your tongue begins lapping at ivy’s wet pussy
>She tastes sweet, but there’s also a faint saltiness, but a noticeable musky undertone as well
>By the time she makes you take a breath, your dick is hard again
>You get on top of Ivy, dick lining up against her wet pussy
>“Well, stop teasing me, your making me antsy”
>With a slow thrust into her, your member is buried deep in her flesh, she is burning hot, and tight as a screw 
>She leglocks you, forcing you to embrace her, take the time to smell her fur
>Clean, but the mixture of artificial perfume and natural oils mess with your mind
>Ivy guides your head for a kiss, your tongues now fighting against each other 
>Pleasure and euphoria wash over you and Ivy, both uncaring over who hears them
>Eventually, it becomes all too much for you to handle
>”You getting close, Don’t worry, I’ll find some way to deal with the aftermath, just cum in me” 
>With one last thrust, you ejaculate whatever cum you had left in you
>You body stops supporting your weight, lay on top of Ivy as both you make a poker table comfortable
>”Thanks for that, I really needed something that good, now I don’t wish to spoil the mood, but we gotta get back to the party
>Shes right, every second you don’t move is a higher chance of getting caught
>After some time to catch your breath, both of you put your clothes back on, and head back to the party
>The most you got was a scolding about never leaving the bar unattended
